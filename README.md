In this project I am writing several generic methods which could be helpful -hopefully- for anyone who checks the repo. I write new methods when i see a new concept in projects
(caused by me being a new guy) or when a new possible need comes to my mind. I write methods flexible as much as I can so they could be used in any project. Enjoy them already!
